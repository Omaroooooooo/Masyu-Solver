# Masyu
Masyu is a logic puzzle made by [Nikoli](https://www.nikoli.co.jp/en/puzzles/masyu/). The game consists of a rectangular grid of cells that can be connected with horizontal or vertical lines. 
Some of these cells are empty, while others contain circles (pearls) that are either black or white. The rules of the puzzle are simple:
1. Draw lines to form a single loop that passes through all the circles.
2. The loop should not branch or cross itself.
3. The loop should pass straight through white circles and make a turn at least on one side after exiting the circle.
4. The loop should make a turn inside black circles and continue straight on both sides at least once after exiting the circle.
